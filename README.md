# 1. hangman
    -This is the common game known as hangman. You get 10 guesses to, obviously, guess the word. Each time you are prompted to guess a letter, if you guess a good letter, the letter will show up in the word and you will still have the same amount of guesses. If a bad letter is guessed you will then move to only 9 more guesses left and so on and so forth for every bad guess. Try to guess the word before you run out of guesses to save the hanging man. After you have either lost or won you will be prompted if you would like to play again. If you choose to play again, a new word will be chosen. If you choose to stop you will be told goodbye, and the game will end.
